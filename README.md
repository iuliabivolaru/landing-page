## Description

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End developer nanodegree.

The skeleton had already some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of a Landing Page. The aim for the project was converting  this static version into a more interactive one.

During this development, I had the chance to practice the concepts presented during this Javascript course, such as adding elements to the DOM, event listeners on elements or using some of the ES6 capabilities.
